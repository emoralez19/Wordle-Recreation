# Wordle Recreation

A recreation of the New York Times web-based word game "Wordle".

## Description

This recreation was chosen as a simple project with the motivation and intention to practice working in Unity. By working on this project, I gained more experience using the Unity UI components and got more familiar and comfortable working with C# syntax and logic. The C# scripts were written using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
